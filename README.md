# SC2-Graphs
Graphs useful data from Starcraft 2 Replays, such as comparing multiple replays to see differences in total supply and worker supply.

I'm kind of awful at git, so you may need to set this up to work on your machine. For instance, using VS code, you might need to set up a virtual environment (ctrl+shift+p, python:create environment, virtual environment) and pip install the necessary imported libraries, e.g. sc2reader, matplotlib, tkinter, etc.
